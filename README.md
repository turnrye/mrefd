# MREFD

This *mrefd* repository builds a new kind of M17 open-source Reflector. Although *mrefd* has evolved, most of the code is originally based on groundbreaking development of XLXD and the copyrights of all relevant source files reflect this. The sources are published under GPL Licenses. *mrefd* works with both M17 modes, Stream and Packet Mode.

**Note:** This version of *mrefd* will link with older version of *mrefd*, called *legacy* (versions **0**.x.y), but there are some thinks you should know about that and there may be some extra steps involved to get the link to work properly!

## Introduction

The *mrefd* reflector is for connecting M17 clients together. *mrefd* can be configured with up to 26 different channels. M17 clients (M17 repeaters, M17 hot-spots and other *mrefd* reflectors) can be linked to a channel. An incoming M17 voice stream or data packet from one of the clients will be sent to all the other clients.

Encrypted voice streams will pass through an *mrefd* channel, but **only** if that channel is configured for it. However, there might be special changes if you
are interlinking to an older version of mrefd. Please see the example `mrefd.interlink` file in the `config` folder.

*mrefd* uses **Ham-DHT**, a distributed hash table network for sharing digital information for ham radio. A **Ham-DHT**-enabled *mrefd* publishes a two-part document on the DHT network. The two parts:
1. Configuration - Connecting clients can use this to know how to connect.
2. Peers - Other mrefd reflectors that are interlinked is in this part.
Either the entire document or a single part of the document may be retrieved.

Only systemd-based operating systems are supported. Debian or Ubuntu is recommended. If you want to install this on a non-systemd based OS, you are on your own. This repository is designed so that you don't have to modify any file in the repository when you build your system. Any file you need to modify to properly configure your reflector will be a file you copy from you locally cloned repo. This makes it easier to update the source code when this repository is updated. Follow the instructions below to build your M17 reflector.

## Parroting

Once a client connects to a module, that client can send a parrot voice stream to reflector that will be echoed back to that client. To perform a parrot make sure your client is connected to any module, set the DST callsign to `#PARROT`, then key up and send an up to 10 second voice stream to the reflector. Anything past 20 seconds (500 M17 Stream Mode packets) will be ignored. Try something like "This is (your-callsign) testing parrot."

When you stop transmitting, the voice data will be returned to your client. This returned Stream Mode packets will have a BROADCAST destination address but will only be sent to your client. And the source callsign will not be changed for the returned stream. While you are transmitting and receiving your parrot stream, you won't hear regular traffic on the module that might be taking place at the same time. The reflector will begin sending the received stream back to your client about 40 milliseconds after it received your last packet. Your transmission will timeout if a Stream Mode packet has not been received for 1.6 seconds since the last packet was received. Whatever has been received up to that point will be sent back to your client after the timeout has occurred. Any metadata in your input stream will not be returned.

Parroting does not work for encrypted streams. If you are digitally signing your stream, the returned stream will not be signed.

Parroting does work in Packet Mode as well, but if your incoming packet doesn't have correctly calculated checksums, or there are inappropriate bits set in the FrameType field, the return packet will be an SMS packet outlining the problems, otherwise it will be identical except that the DST will be set to the BROADCAST address and the LSF checksum will be recalculated.

In fact, parroting can be triggered with any DST that contains the string `PARROT`, but this is deprecated behavior. It is planned that in a future release, it will only respond to `#PARROT`.

## A few words about valid client callsigns

A client callsign must begin with something that looks like a legal callsign: it begins with an optional digit, followed by one or two letters followed by one or two digit, followed by one to four letters. After that, any valid M17 characters can appear as a suffix as long as the first of these suffix characters is a non-alphanumeric M17 character, *i.e.*, a space (`' '`), period (`'.'`), slash (`'/'`) or dash (`'-'`).

## Usage

The packages which are described in this document are designed to install server software which is used for the digital voice network infrastructure. It requires a 24/7 internet connection which can support 20 voice streams or more to connect repeaters and hot-spots and other digital voice clients!

- The server can build a reflector that support IPv4, IPv6 or both (dual stack).
- The public IP addresses should have a DNS record which must be published in the common host files.

## Installation

Below are instructions for building an mrefd reflector.

### After a clean installation of a Debian-based OS make sure to run update and upgrade

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

### Required packages (some of these may already be installed)

```bash
sudo apt install git build-essential g++ libcurl4-gnutls-dev
```

The `libcurl4-gnutls-dev` package is only necessary if you use OpenDHT. OpenDHT and gomrefdash both have their own requirements.

### Ham-DHT support (optional, but highly recommended)

**Ham-DHT** is implemented using a distributed hash table provided by OpenDHT.

If you are using a new OS, like Debian 12 or Ubuntu 24, you may not have to build the OpenDHT support. Try:

```
sudo apt install libopendht-dev
```

If the description shows that this package was build with C++17 or newer, go ahead and let it install, otherwise you should build your own version of the OpenDHT library.

OpenDHT is available [here](https://github.com/savoirfairelinux/opendht.git). Building and installing instructions are in the [OpenDHT Wiki](https://github.com/savoirfairelinux/opendht/wiki/Build-the-library). Python support and proxy-server support (RESTinio) is not required for mrefd and so can be considered optional. With this in mind, this should work on Debian/Ubuntu-based systems:

```bash
# Install OpenDHT dependencies
sudo apt install libncurses5-dev libreadline-dev nettle-dev libgnutls28-dev libargon2-0-dev libmsgpack-dev  libssl-dev libfmt-dev libjsoncpp-dev libhttp-parser-dev libasio-dev cmake pkg-config libcppunit-dev

# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/savoirfairelinux/opendht.git

# build and install
cd opendht
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DOPENDHT_PYTHON=OFF -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ..
make
sudo make install
```

Please note that if you end up building the OpenDHT library, there is no easy way to uninstall it once it's been installed.

### Download the *mrefd* repository and enter the directory

```bash
git clone https://github.com/n7tae/mrefd.git
cd mrefd
```

### Create and edit your blacklist, whitelist and linking files

```bash
cp config/mrefd.blacklist .
cp config/mrefd.whitelist .
cp config/mrefd.interlink .
```

Use your favorite editor to modify each of these files. If you want a totally open network, the blacklist and whitelist files are ready to go. The blacklist determine which callsigns can't use the reflector. The whitelist determines which callsigns can use the reflector. The mrefd reflector will monitor these file and dynamically update itself whenever anything changes. There is no need to stop and restart the reflector.

The `mrefd.interlink` file sets up the M17<--->M17 peer group linking. Please read the comments in this file in the `config` folder. An M17 interlink has to be configured on both sides of the link. Linked reflectors can share multiple modules, but cross module linking, for example, linking M17-000 module A to M17-001 module B is not supported. Using the **Ham-DHT** greatly simplifies setting up a peer group. You don't have to specify an IP address or port number as the **Ham-DHT** will provided it, along with any other information it needs to interlink with a peer. Using the **Ham-DHT** will prevent you from interlinking a channel where the peer module has encryption enabled and you do not, or *vis versa*.

If your reflector or your desired peer doesn't use **Ham-DHT**, you can specify the IP address and port in the mrefd.interlink file. It will be then up to the reflector admins to make sure the encryption configurations match.

Group administration will require coordination among the admins of all involved reflectors. If a group member drops out or if a new member wants to join a group, all other group members will need to remove or add a line to their mrefd.interlink file.

### Configuring your reflector

Configuring, compiling and maintaining your reflector build is easy! Start by copying the configuration example files:

```bash
cp example.mk mrefd.mk     # this  file  sets the compile-time configuration
cp example.cfg mrefd.cfg   # while this file sets the run-time configuration
```

Use your favorite editor to edit mrefd.mk and mrefd.cfg. These file contains comments so it should be obvious what values need changing.

### Compiling and installing your system

After you have written your configuration files, you can build and install your system:

```bash
make && sudo make install
```

Use this command to compile and install your system. Use `sudo make uninstall` to uninstall mrefd.

### Stopping and starting the service manually

To stop the execution of mrefd:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop mrefd
```

You can start mrefd by replacing `stop` with `start`, or you can restart it by using `restart`.

To view the mrefd log:

```bash
sudo journalctl -u mrefd -f
```

The blacklist, whitelist and interlink files can be modified in real time while xrfd is executing and the reflector will update itself within a few seconds. If `USESYMLINK` is true in your mrefd.mk file, then you can edit the files in your build directory. Otherwise, you will need to edit the files in the `CFGDIR` folder.

### Install the Dashboard

Also include in this repo is a simple php-based dashboard that's easy to install and use. This dashboard is in the `php-dash` folder. The `php-dash/README.md` file explains how to configure your dashboard. If you are new to setting up a webserver there are also instructions for installing and configuring a simple webserver.

As an alternative, DU8BL has updated the original go-based dashboard so it now supports the latest version of mrefd and is available [here](https://github.com/DU8BL/gomrefdash).

## Updating mrefd

Here is the safest way to update your reflector:

```bash
sudo make uninstall
make clean
git pull
make
sudo make install
```

If, after doing the `git pull`, you see that it's downloaded a new example.cfg file, it would probably be a good idea to remake your mrefd.cfg file. There may be new options of which you might want to take advantage, or old options that are no longer supported or needed.

## Running multiple instances

It should be fairly straightforward to install multiple mrefd instances on a single server. Make sure each instance is using a different listening port. Things to me aware of:

- The reflector executable name is defined in the Makefile at the line "EXE=mrefd".
- The configuration file is read at start-up and defined in mrefd.service file. Each instance would require a different service file.
- Each instance will need its own config files with unique paths to those files.
- Each instance will need a unique url so that each will have its own webpage.
- Need to add unix sockets for interlinking between instances.
- Only one reflector can use the Ham-DHT.

This is **not** a task for a beginner!

## Firewall settings

MREFD requires the following port to be open to inbound network traffic:

- UDP port 17000 (or whatever port you have configured) for M17
- UDP port 17171 for DHT
- TCP port 80 for HTTP
- TCP port 443 for HTTPS
